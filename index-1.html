          In truth dying on mars is actually quite easy. Whether it be by freeze to death, suffocation, radiation exposure, an asteroid, pick your poison. But dying is an inevitability, but living is the question, what are the barriers to life on our red neighbor? Are they surmountable today or will they be in the future? One of the major issues of living on Mars is the need for water<i class="bi bi-droplet"></i>. Scientist have found some indications of Ice on the planet’s surface, though most is thought to be CO2, but some is thought to be possibly water though far too salty to drink. But we could possibly make it useable. The question now is how much is accessible and what will the process be to make it of use?</figcaption><br>
        <figcaption>The next issue is oxygen, that in theory has been solved. <span class="text-success">NASA was able to make breathable air from the atmosphere during their test using instruments on the Perseverance rover.</span> This bodes well, not only for Mars but for other potential planets, and moon as well.</figcaption>

	<figcaption>Now that we gotten breathing and fuel (both eating and energy) out of the way, we must talk about the environment. Mars in general is a hospitable place, it has temperature that range from -220 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit, with an average of -81. Not good habitable for more than a few species on earth. With a lack of a rotating core this is not going to change anytime soon. Without a core to create a magnetic field to protect the planet from solar winds, there will be no remaking of the Martian atmosphere, therefore most likely never a day where we will be strolling suit less on the planet at all.</figcaption><br> 
	<figcaption>Therefore our best bet would be to create underground habitats that are far enough down to shield us from storm planetary and extra planetary. Then comes gravity and atmospheric pressure. We do not know if we as humans can give birth or live in these Martian conditions. How will the lack of gravity and pressure affect our hearts, bones, muscles, and brains? Can a Martian ever come back to earth? 
	These are just a few issues that I believe will be keeping us from ever being able to sustain a human life on mars. There are probably many more, but I am not an Bio astrologist. </figcaption>
